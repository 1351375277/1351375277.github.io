Release Notes Archive:

This driver update is for Mac Pro 5,1 (2010), Mac Pro 4,1 (2009) and Mac Pro 3,1 (2008) users.
BETA support is for iMac 14,2 / 14,3 (2013), iMac 13,1 / 13,2 (2012) and MacBook Pro 11,3 (2013), MacBook Pro 10,1 (2012), and MacBook Pro 9,1 (2012) users.

NVIDIA has released their alternate graphics drivers for OS X Yosemite 10.10.4. These are separate from the drivers Apple ships as standard, and should be considered experimental. These drivers have been known to solve OpenCL issues with certain applications, as well as providing better native GPU power management for certain devices.

*NOTE: These drivers are currently the only method to get full acceleration for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750, 750Ti, 960, 970, and 980 &#8216;Maxwell graphics cards. There are no current Macs with these cards, so support is absent natively in OS X.*  
If youve installed the drivers before, you may get a notification to update to the new drivers from the built in System Preferences pane.

NOTE: In addition to setting nvda\_drv=1 to NVRAM, as required by real Macs, NVIDIA now adds nvda\_drv=1 kernel flag to `/Extra/org.Chameleon.boot.plist` automatically. There are no additional steps to take.
